Description: This package allows you to play with the [Monty Hall Problem](http://www.montyhallproblem.com/). The Monty Hall Problem is a great example of a mathematical problem that might be hard to solve using a mathematical proof, but it is fairly easy to solve using simulation. Since it is just a game with simple and explicit rules we can build our own virtual version. Then we can compare how outcomes differ when we deploy the two different strategies for selecting doors. Give it a go, and see if you can "Win a Brand New Car!"
